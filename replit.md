- Custom domain support via CNAME file
- `.nojekyll` file prevents Jekyll processing

**Rationale**: GitHub Pages chosen for:
- Zero cost
- Automatic HTTPS
- Built-in CDN
- No server maintenance
- Git-based deployment workflow
- Perfect for static sites

**Alternative Deployment Options**:
- Netlify: Drag-and-drop or Git integration

- Traditional hosting: FTP upload of docs/ folder

### SEO and Social Media Integration

**Meta Tag Strategy**:

- Twitter Card tags for Twitter sharing
- Comprehensive meta descriptions and keywords
- Structured semantic HTML for search engines

**Social Sharing Configuration**:

- Description optimized for social platforms

**Favicon and Branding**:
- PNG favicon using HubForge logo
- Logo asset in navigation and footer

## External Dependencies

### Third-Party Services

**Google Fonts**:
- **Service**: Typography CDN
- **Font Used**: Inter (weights: 300, 400, 600, 700, 800)
- **Integration**: Preconnect hints + stylesheet link
- **Rationale**: Modern, professional typeface with excellent readability; display=swap ensures text remains visible during load

### Asset Dependencies

**Static Assets**:
- Logo: `./assets/images/logo.png` (HubForge HF. logo with brand colors)
- Banner: `./assets/images/banner.png` (Social media sharing image)

**Note**: No JavaScript frameworks, CSS frameworks, or external libraries required. Site is intentionally dependency-light for maximum resilience and performance.

### Domain and Hosting

**GitHub Pages**:
- **Purpose**: Static site hosting and deployment
- **Configuration**: Branch-based deployment from `main` → `docs/` folder
- **Custom Domain**: Can be configured via CNAME file (e.g., hubforge.org)

**No Database**: Purely static content; no backend or data storage required.

**No Authentication**: Public-facing informational website with no user accounts or protected content.

**No APIs**: No external API integrations; all content is hardcoded HTML.
