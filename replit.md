## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Technology Stack**: Pure HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript - no frameworks or build tools required.

**Design Philosophy**: 
- Static site architecture for maximum performance and zero backend dependencies
- Mobile-first responsive design approach
- SpaceX-inspired minimal aesthetic with bold typography and ample whitespace
- Progressive enhancement strategy
- Component-based CSS organization using CSS custom properties

**Rationale**: Chose a static approach to ensure:
- Lightning-fast page loads (<50KB initial load)
- Zero hosting costs (GitHub Pages)
- Maximum accessibility and SEO
- No build process complexity
- Easy maintenance for non-technical contributors

```

**CSS Architecture**:
- CSS custom properties for theming (brand colors, spacing, typography)
- Mobile-first media queries
- Smooth cubic-bezier transitions and animations
- SpaceX-inspired minimal aesthetic with gradient accents
- BEM-like naming conventions for maintainability

**JavaScript Architecture**:
- Pure vanilla JavaScript (ES6+, no dependencies)
- IIFE pattern for scope isolation
- Event delegation for performance
- Progressive enhancement - site works without JavaScript
- Features: mobile menu toggle, smooth scroll, intersection observers, lazy loading

**Accessibility Strategy**:
- Semantic HTML5 elements (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, etc.)
- ARIA labels and roles for screen readers
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance target
- Keyboard navigation support with ESC key for menu
- Focus-visible indicators
- `aria-expanded` state management for mobile menu

**Performance Optimizations**:
- Preconnect hints for Google Fonts (Inter typeface)
- Font display swap strategy
- Minimal external dependencies (only Google Fonts)
- Lazy loading support for images
- Optimized asset loading
- Debounced scroll events
- Intersection Observer for animations

### Content Sections

1. **Hero Section**: Main vision statement with animated background gradients
2. **Vision Section**: "A just and thriving world" statement on dark background
3. **Mission Section**: Nurturing globally connected, locally rooted ecosystems
4. **Why HubForge**: Purpose statement - "Impact shouldn't depend on privilege"
5. **Values Section**: Five core values with gradient icon cards
6. **Programs Section**: Three programs with numbered cards on dark background
7. **Contact Section**: CTA with email and call-to-action buttons
8. **Footer**: Navigation links, programs, contact info

### Deployment Architecture

**Platform**: GitHub Pages (static hosting)

**Deployment Strategy**: 
- Source files live in `docs/` directory
- Automatic deployment via GitHub Pages from `main` branch → `/docs` folder
- Custom domain support via CNAME file
- `.nojekyll` file prevents Jekyll processing

**Rationale**: GitHub Pages chosen for:
- Zero cost
- Automatic HTTPS
- Built-in CDN
- No server maintenance
- Git-based deployment workflow
- Perfect for static sites

**Alternative Deployment Options**:
- Netlify: Drag-and-drop or Git integration
- Vercel: Import from GitHub
- Traditional hosting: FTP upload of docs/ folder

### SEO and Social Media Integration

**Meta Tag Strategy**:
- Open Graph tags for Facebook/LinkedIn sharing
- Twitter Card tags for Twitter sharing
- Comprehensive meta descriptions and keywords
- Structured semantic HTML for search engines

**Social Sharing Configuration**:
- OG image: banner.png with HubForge branding
- OG title: "HubForge - Where Social Insights Shape a Better Tomorrow"
- Description optimized for social platforms

**Favicon and Branding**:
- PNG favicon using HubForge logo
- Logo asset in navigation and footer

## External Dependencies

### Third-Party Services

**Google Fonts**:
- **Service**: Typography CDN
- **Font Used**: Inter (weights: 300, 400, 600, 700, 800)
- **Integration**: Preconnect hints + stylesheet link
- **Rationale**: Modern, professional typeface with excellent readability; display=swap ensures text remains visible during load

### Asset Dependencies

**Static Assets**:
- Logo: `./assets/images/logo.png` (HubForge HF. logo with brand colors)
- Banner: `./assets/images/banner.png` (Social media sharing image)

**Note**: No JavaScript frameworks, CSS frameworks, or external libraries required. Site is intentionally dependency-light for maximum resilience and performance.

### Domain and Hosting

**GitHub Pages**:
- **Purpose**: Static site hosting and deployment
- **Configuration**: Branch-based deployment from `main` → `docs/` folder
- **Custom Domain**: Can be configured via CNAME file (e.g., hubforge.org)

**No Database**: Purely static content; no backend or data storage required.

**No Authentication**: Public-facing informational website with no user accounts or protected content.

**No APIs**: No external API integrations; all content is hardcoded HTML.
