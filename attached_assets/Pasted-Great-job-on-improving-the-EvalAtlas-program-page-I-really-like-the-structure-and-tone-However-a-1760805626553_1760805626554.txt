Great job on improving the EvalAtlas program page — I really like the structure and tone!
However, a few key updates and small fixes are needed 👇

Overall context:
I’m updating the HubForge Global Impact Network website — specifically, the EvalAtlas content and visuals. The aim is to make it globally credible yet locally rooted, keeping the inclusive and collaborative spirit of HubForge.

Here’s what I want you to do:

Main Page (EvalAtlas Section)

The content here still seems unchanged — please update it using the improved EvalAtlas description from the program page.

Make it short and inspiring (2–3 lines max).

Add a call to action like:

“Join us in building an inclusive evaluation ecosystem that connects people, ideas, and action.”

The tone should match HubForge’s style: clear, inclusive, visionary, and collaborative.

EvalAtlas Program Page – Small Tweaks Only

In the “Create Your Profile” section:

Change the title to “Coming Soon”.

Below it, add this call to action:

“If you’re interested in co-building this feature or partnering with us, connect with us.”

You can link the “connect with us” text to the Contact or Partner page.

EvalAtlas Program Page – Visual/Font Fix

In the “Who is this for” section:

The titles (like NGO, Philanthropies, Researchers, etc.) aren’t clearly visible — check the font color, weight, or contrast and fix it so that titles stand out from the body text.

Ensure consistent heading hierarchy and readable contrast (AA standard).

Don’t change the rest of the EvalAtlas Program page content — the narrative and structure are good as they are.

Output expected:

Updated main page EvalAtlas section (text + CTA)

Updated EvalAtlas Program page with the two small text changes and visual fixes.

Ensure all pages remain mobile-friendly and accessible (good contrast, clear headings, alt text).

Tone and style reminder:

Global yet approachable.

Collaborative and community-centered.

Focused on bridging gaps and connecting people in the evaluation ecosystem.
