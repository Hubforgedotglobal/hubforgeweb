I want you to create and update a new section on the HubForge Global Impact Network website for the Glocal Impact Awards 2026.
This initiative reflects our belief that anyone can be a champion of evidence for good — not just traditional M&E professionals.

Core idea (raw content):
The Glocal Impact Awards 2026 aim to recognise and celebrate people and institutions around the world who are building, innovating, or using evidence for good — irrespective of their designation, affiliation, or background.

It’s not limited to people with fancy degrees, titles, or traditional M&E roles.
It’s about honouring anyone or any community using data, evidence, and learning to create better programs, stronger voices, and smarter policies.

The awards celebrate inclusivity, innovation, and the spirit of “global + local” action — spotlighting changemakers who prove that evidence belongs to everyone.

We’re also inviting partners and collaborators to join us in co-creating and shaping the 2026 edition.

What to do:

Create a dedicated section (or page) titled “Glocal Impact Awards 2026”.

You can place a short highlight/teaser on the main page, and a full section or separate page under Programs or Initiatives.

Tone and design:

Tone: bold, inclusive, inspiring, globally relevant yet locally rooted.

Use HubForge’s design language (clean, minimal, accessible).

Include diverse imagery or subtle global visuals to represent inclusivity.

Structure suggestion for the page:

Hero headline: inspiring statement about reimagining recognition in evidence.

Short paragraph: explain what Glocal Impact Awards are and why they exist.

Subsection: who it celebrates (e.g., “For individuals, institutions, communities innovating with evidence for change”).

Call to Action (CTA):

“We’re inviting partners, institutions, and changemakers to collaborate in shaping the 2026 edition. Join us in redefining what recognition means in the world of evidence.”

Add a CTA button or link: “Partner with Us” or “Get Involved”.

Accessibility & layout:

Ensure strong contrast, readable typography, and mobile-friendly layout.

Add meaningful alt text for any images or icons.

Optional visual idea: subtle world map or connected dots motif to represent global–local connections.

Output expected:

New “Glocal Impact Awards 2026” section (main highlight + full page)

Finalized text, layout, and CTA button

Proofread and polished for clarity, inclusivity, and brand alignment with HubForge

HubForge brand tone:
Visionary yet grounded.
Global, collaborative, and people-first.
Centered on accessibility, inclusion, and the democratization of evaluation and evidence.
