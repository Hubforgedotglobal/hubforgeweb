the HubForge site (static HTML/CSS/JS). On desktop it looks good, but on phones many elements are stuck, overlapping, or not adapting correctly. Please audit and fix the entire website so it is mobile-first and all visuals adapt cleanly to common phone sizes (320px–430px widths) and tablets.

Scope / goals

Make the site mobile-first and responsive at common breakpoints (≤360px, 375px, 412px, 425px, 768px).

Fix layout issues where elements “stick”, overflow, overlap, or don’t reflow on narrow screens.

Ensure navigation, hero, cards, grids, forms, images, tables, and footers behave correctly on phones.

Keep the desktop design intact — only improve CSS/structure so it adapts naturally.

What to check & fix (concrete):

Viewport meta — ensure <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"> in every page head.

Container widths — convert fixed widths (px) to fluid units (%, max-width, rem) or use CSS grid/flex with sensible wrap rules. Replace width: 1200px–style rules that break on narrow screens.

Images & media — add srcset/sizes, max-width:100%, and height:auto; use loading="lazy" for non-critical images.

Hero and header — make hero content stack vertically on small screens; ensure CTA buttons remain visible without horizontal scroll. Transform wide multi-column hero into single-column on phones.

Navigation — implement or fix a mobile menu / hamburger that is keyboard accessible and dismissible. Ensure nav links are tappable (min 44px target).

Cards / grids — change multi-column grids to 1 column on small screens (use CSS grid grid-template-columns: 1fr or flex flex-direction: column).

Forms & inputs — make inputs full-width, increase tap targets, label spacing, and place buttons under inputs on mobile.

Typography — use responsive font sizes (clamp() or rem with media queries) to avoid overflow and ensure readability.

Spacing & overflow — remove horizontal scroll by fixing any overflow-x issues, long min-width, or negative margins. Add box-sizing: border-box globally.

Buttons & CTAs — ensure buttons are responsive, do not exceed viewport, and have consistent padding and touch size.

Third-party embeds — make iframes, embeds, and social cards responsive with aspect-ratio wrappers.

Contrast & accessibility on mobile — ensure contrast and focus outlines remain visible at small sizes.

Deliverables

Updated site files (HTML/CSS/JS) with mobile-first changes and no broken desktop layout.

A short CHANGELOG.md listing key fixes and files changed.

Example screenshots (mobile widths 375px & 412px) after changes (place in /assets/screenshots/).

Clear commit history with messages:

fix(responsive): add viewport meta & global box-sizing

fix(responsive): fluid containers and responsive hero

fix(nav): mobile hamburger & accessible menu

perf(images): responsive images + lazy load

A short testing checklist in README explaining how to test on device (incognito, Chrome device toolbar, real phone).

Constraints & style

Minimize new dependencies — prefer vanilla CSS (or Tailwind if site already uses it).

Keep file sizes small; optimize images added.

Maintain existing visual brand (colors, fonts) unless contrast or accessibility requires slight adjustments — flag those changes.

Testing requirements

Verify pages at breakpoints: 360px, 375px, 412px, 425px, 768px. Provide screenshots and list any unresolved issues.

Test keyboard navigation and tap targets for nav and forms.

Confirm no horizontal scroll appears on mobile.
