Reimagining how the world builds and shares evidence for change.
At HubForge, we believe real change begins with strong ecosystems.
When communities, youth, and grassroots changemakers can measure what matters, learn from it, and act on it, they shape their own futures—and transform the world around them.

But too often, those closest to the problems have the least access to evidence, networks, and opportunities.

We’re here to change that.

Our Vision

"We envision a just and thriving world where communities, youth, and grassroots changemakers have the ecosystem strength to build and share evidence, uniting local wisdom and global knowledge to drive lasting, transformative change."

Our Mission
We’re nurturing a globally connected, locally rooted ecosystem where changemakers—from village leaders to global institutions—can collaborate, learn, and thrive.

By strengthening networks, sharing knowledge, and unlocking tools and opportunities, we help communities take ownership of their evidence and scale what truly works.

We stay practical, hands-on, and real-world focused, ensuring every action leads to meaningful, lasting change.

Our Values
Evidence with Heart – Data should serve people, not the other way around.

Local Wisdom First – Communities know their context best—we listen and co-create.

Global Connections, Shared Growth – Knowledge is collective power; we share it freely.

Practical over Perfect – Solutions must work on the ground, not just on paper.

Youth as Catalysts – The future of evidence belongs to the next generation.

Why HubForge. Exists
Because impact shouldn’t depend on privilege.
Every changemaker—no matter where they are—should have access to evidence, tools, networks, and opportunities to make their solutions stronger and their voices louder.

HubForge. aspire to forge those connections, building an ecosystem where evidence drives lasting, transformative change.

Our Programs
1. HubForge Impact Lab
Our first initiative, the Impact Lab, strengthens the Monitoring, Evaluation, Research, and Learning (MERL) ecosystem at the grassroots. It provides volunteer-driven support to nonprofits and community-based organisations.

By equipping these organisations with essential MERL skills, tools, and resources, the Impact Lab empowers them to generate data-driven insights, improve decision-making, and enhance program effectiveness.

2. EvalAtlass.
EvalAtlas is a global, open-access directory for the evaluation profession. It connects evaluators, agencies, vendors, and training institutions in one place.

EvalAtlass makes expertise visible, searchable, and accessible by:

Mapping evaluators, agencies, vendors, and institutions globally

Organising expertise by skills, methods, sectors, and availability

Using technology to connect local talent with global opportunities

This living atlas strengthens evidence ecosystems by bridging local expertise and global demand.

3. HubForge Glocal Impact Awards for Monitoring & Evaulation (GIA-M&E)
The Glocal Impact Awards celebrate changemakers who champion evidence at the grassroots. Too often, local leaders and organisations remain unrecognised in global evaluation spaces.

GIA-M&E highlights and honours these evidence champions, amplifying their voices and encouraging others to build strong, evidence-based practices.

The awards are part of our vision to elevate Global leadership in evaluation and ensure that those closest to the challenges are also recognised for driving solutions.

Join us in forging a future where evidence-driven decision-making empowers social impact organizations to thrive.
