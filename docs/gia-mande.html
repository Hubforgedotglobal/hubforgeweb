            <h2>Why These Awards Exist</h2>
            <p>Let's be honest: When people talk about "global leaders in evaluation," they usually mean consultants from well-known firms or academics at prestigious universities. Meanwhile, there are brilliant evaluators, grassroots organizers, and community leaders doing exceptional MERL work—but nobody outside their immediate circle knows their names.</p>
            <p>That's not right. The people doing some of the most innovative, contextually relevant evaluation work are local changemakers who understand their communities deeply and build evidence systems that actually work for real people.</p>
            <p>The Glocal Impact Awards for M&E (GIA-M&E) exist to change that narrative. We celebrate grassroots evidence champions—the ones who might not have fancy degrees or big budgets, but who are proving every day that great evaluation work happens everywhere, not just in global capitals.</p>

                    <h3>Individual Champion</h3>
                    <p>For the person who's been championing evidence-based practices in their community—building M&E systems, training others, and showing what's possible even when resources are tight.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="simple-card">
                    <h3>Grassroots Organization</h3>
                    <p>For community organizations that have made M&E a core part of how they work—not because a donor demanded it, but because they genuinely want to learn and improve what they're doing.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="simple-card">

                    <p>For young changemakers (under 35) who are doing things differently—bringing fresh ideas to M&E, using creative approaches, and inspiring their peers to care about evidence.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="simple-card">
                    <h3>Collaborative Impact</h3>
                    <p>For partnerships or networks that prove collaboration works—pooling resources, sharing knowledge, and building evaluation capacity together rather than competing.</p>

                <div class="list-item">
                    <h3>Spotlight the Unsung Heroes</h3>
                    <p>There are people doing incredible M&E work in their communities who deserve recognition. Not because they need external validation, but because their stories can inspire others and show what's possible.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="list-item">
                    <h3>Show What's Possible</h3>
                    <p>When you see someone like you—working with limited resources in a similar context—doing amazing evaluation work, it suddenly feels achievable. That's the power of real stories from real people.</p>

                <div class="list-item">
                    <h3>Connect Different Worlds</h3>
                    <p>Global evaluation networks need to hear from grassroots practitioners. And local changemakers deserve access to global resources and connections. These awards help bridge that gap.</p>
