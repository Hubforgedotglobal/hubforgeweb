            <h2>What is the Impact Lab?</h2>
            <p>Here's the reality: Most grassroots organizations don't have a MERL expert on staff. They're doing incredible work in their communities, but when it comes to measuring impact, designing surveys, or building evaluation frameworks—they're often on their own.</p>
            <p>That's where the Impact Lab comes in. We connect these organizations with skilled volunteers who bring real MERL expertise. Think of it as pro bono consulting meets hands-on mentorship. Our volunteers work alongside local teams, helping them build the monitoring and evaluation systems they need to understand what's working, what's not, and why it matters.</p>
            <p>The goal isn't just to do the work for them—it's to build lasting capacity so they can continue measuring their impact long after our support ends.</p>
