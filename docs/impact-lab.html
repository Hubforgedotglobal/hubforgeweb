                    <h2 class="content-title">What is the Impact Lab?</h2>
                    <p class="content-text">
                        Here's the reality: Most grassroots organizations don't have a MERL expert on staff. They're doing incredible work in their communities, but when it comes to measuring impact, designing surveys, or building evaluation frameworks—they're often on their own.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-text">
                        That's where the Impact Lab comes in. We connect these organizations with skilled volunteers who bring real MERL expertise. Think of it as pro bono consulting meets hands-on mentorship. Our volunteers work alongside local teams, helping them build the monitoring and evaluation systems they need to understand what's working, what's not, and why it matters.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-text">
                        The goal isn't just to do the work for them—it's to build lasting capacity so they can continue measuring their impact long after our support ends.
